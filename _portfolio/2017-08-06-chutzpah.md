Chutzpah /ˈxʊtspə,ˈhʊtspə/ Is defined as extreme self-confidence or audacity. Chutzpah Company described their branding needs and based on research we designed their company logo.

Inspiration for the logo came from the Sun (I mean what is more audacity?) The logo embodies qualities like self confidence, pride and bold beauty.
