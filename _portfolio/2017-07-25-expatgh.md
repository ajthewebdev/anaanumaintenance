Project Brief
=============
Camus, the newly established French-Algerian restaurant to hit Northcote, is inspired by chef Pierre Khodja’s life and its parallels to Albert Camus. The restaurant brings the flavours and vibrancy of North African cuisine to Melbourne with a French twist.

The brand explores Pierre’s personal heritage, from his recollections of his mother tattooing in the traditional Berber style to his connection to Camus' writing on Algerian life (and death). We collaborated with the restaurant's team to bring this into the dining experience. A combination of French noir and lively Algerian imagery tell stories of Pierre’s heritage across the printed assets. Albert Camus quotes about life and passion litter the walls drawing parallels to the reasons Pierre cooks: authenticity and honesty, sharing with loved ones, and a sense of home.


Work Done
=========
We created a custom typeface and series of symbols inspired by the traditional Algerian tattooing of Pierre's mother.
