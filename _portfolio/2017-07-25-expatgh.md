We built a brochure website for Expat Gh Relocation Services Ltd. a local concierge startup in the Real Estate industry.

Background
----------
Expat Gh Relocation Services Ltd. is a Ghanaian owned startup in the real estate industry. Expat Gh is setup to provide tailored relocation services to expats/returnees in Greater Accra, Ghana. The company is willing to engage in other related services with the prime mission of making the settling process as comfortable and stress free as possible - Expat Gh is considered a concierge service company dedicated to the needs of expats in Ghana.

Challenge
---------
Expat Gh being a new company, has no online presence. Potential clients usually look online for information and services that will make their move to Ghana easier. This client does not have a way to reach their target market.

Solution
---------
We designed and built a beautiful brochure website for Expat Gh Relocation Services Ltd.
Before this project was taken offline, it was the company's main website for a year (2016 -2017).
