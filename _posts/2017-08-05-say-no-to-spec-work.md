Spec work is any kind of creative work done by web designers (and other professionals) and submitted to would be clients before paying for the service.

Unfortunately, many web creatives like myself have experienced a client asking them to submit spec work in the guise of an entry exam or a “test” of their skill. I wonder if the same rules applied to other professionals? #saynotospecwork

The following video on youtube paints a close enough reaction.
