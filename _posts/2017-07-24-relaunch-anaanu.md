I worked so hard on this. Welcome to the relaunch of my studio's portfolio website www.anaanu.site
Thanks to our new friend Travis CI (a continuous integration server), instead of going through many iterations while the domain host stays parked, is very suspicious to say the very least.

And these are not even my words, they are from a client. On that occassion, the client was a friend and that's how I found out but pause. With continious integration, I have launched, while I continue to build and design the studio's website without ever going offline which means losing clients and money.

It took me a year but I'm here. Welcome to my journey, support, like, share, show some love. My company is Anaanu Webstudio.
