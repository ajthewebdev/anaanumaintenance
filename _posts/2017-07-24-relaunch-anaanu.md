I have worked so hard on this. Welcome to the relaunch of my studio's portfolio website www.anaanu.site
For a year, we have been experimenting and sampling different visual brand elements. From these experiences, so many lessons have been learned. I am grateful.

The company logo has gone through an evolution
----------------
Did you know that, orbits of celestial objects like planets in outer space are
elliptical in shape? Yeah, for a long time I also imagined they would be just circular. Anaanu Webstudioâ€™s logo was designed to pay homage to the beauty and brilliance of this universe. Building and designing things based on inspiration from the universe is an old tradition dating back to the time of the first men. I am proud to be part of this tradition.
